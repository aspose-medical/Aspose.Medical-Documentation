# Data manipulation

Data manipulation is a fundamental aspect of working with `DICOM` files, allowing developers to extract, modify, and enhance medical imaging data. This section covers essential operations for interacting with `DICOM` datasets, including retrieving existing values, updating attributes, and adding new data elements. These capabilities enable seamless integration with medical imaging workflows, ensuring accurate and efficient processing of `DICOM` metadata and pixel data.

The following subsections will guide you through accessing `DICOM` attributes, modifying tag values, and extending the dataset with additional information.
